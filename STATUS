Code is working on the command line, but not yet been thoroughly tested.
There are some 'xdg-open' commands to serve for debugging.
These will go away when in production.

Currently, the filter uses HTML as its intermediate format.
From HTML it creates TWO output PDF files:

* one with the help of a 'pandoc' command,
* the other with the help of a 'htmldoc' command.

Both are saved to a temporary file.
For real usage as a banner-to-pdf filter, output needs to go to stdout.

I used Pandoc v2.1.3 and HTMLdoc v1.9.5 for my tests.
Should test with older versions and then recommend a minimum version.
